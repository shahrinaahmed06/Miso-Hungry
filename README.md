# Miso Hungry Game

COMP602 Software Development Practice

**About Game**

Dinner tonight, yea alright!
You play as a lad who has forgotten to cook dinner for tonight!
it is your job to get through the levels  with all the ingredients you need to cook dinner that night.

Miso Hungry Game revolves around the player collecting miso and other ingredients while evading obstacles and finally reach the checkout in a given period of time in each level.
There are three levels in which level 1 serves as tutorial level while level 2 and 3 is where player begins their challenge! 
Each level has their own difficulty level based on the time limit, amount of collectible sprites and obstacles.

Collecting the miso and ingredients will add to your score points, whereas colliding with the obstacles will deduct your score. Be careful! When timer runs out or your score reaches 0, game is over and you have to restart the level!

Goodluck making your dinner!
